ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Project!

Hello! Iâ€™m Clarence F. Villas, a Diploma in Information Technology student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Taguig Campus. 

This repository contains my academic projects, exercises, and explorations in programming. 

My goal is to apply what I learn in class to real-world scenarios, while continuously improving my technical and problem-solving skills.

Exploring tech, one line of code at a time.

âœ¨ Feel free to explore my work and connect with me! âœ¨
